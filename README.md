## Motivation

Most Discord bot templates out there use Discord.js in a raw form, inside a plain Node app. This is fine for small bots, but as your bot grows, you might find yourself struggling to keep your code organized and maintainable. NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework that helps you build efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. It provides a modular architecture, dependency injection, and a powerful CLI, making it easier to manage complex applications. Necord is a framework built on top of Discord.js that leverages the power of NestJS to create Discord bots with a clean and structured approach.

With this template, you can quickly set up a Discord bot using NestJS and have a solid foundation to build upon. Additionally, having a NestJS-based bot can be beneficial if you plan to integrate your bot with a web application or API, as you can share code and services between the two. This means that using this template, you can eventually expand your bot's functionality to include a REST API that can interact with your bot. This is particularly useful for creating web dashboards, managing bot settings, or providing additional services to your users.

This template aims to provide a concise yet comprehensive starting point for building a Discord bot. The goal of this template is to touch a little bit of every capability of a Discord bot, without going too deep into any specific feature. This way, you get a thrashable example of how to use various features of a Discord bot, and you can then expand upon them as needed. In other words, this template is not meant to be a fully-featured bot, but rather a starting point for building your own bot.
